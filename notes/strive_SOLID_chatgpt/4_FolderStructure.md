# Question:

```
I see that you have grouped the functions into packages based on what they do. For example, all handlers functions are part of the handler package regardless of which feature they belong to (Sales, User, Product). Is this the convention in Go. Or did you just add it so that I can understand better? I just want to where it is good idea to group the functions based on what they do or based on the feature?
```


Great question! The way you structure your Go project depends on the complexity of your application and how you want to maintain it. There are **two main approaches** to structuring packages:  

---

## **1️⃣ Grouping by Layer (Technical Separation)**
This is the approach I used in my example:  

📂 `repository/` → Contains all repository functions  
📂 `service/` → Business logic and service layer  
📂 `handler/` → HTTP handlers for API endpoints  

Example:
```
your_project/
│── repository/
│   ├── sales_repository.go
│   ├── user_repository.go
│   ├── product_repository.go
│── service/
│   ├── sales_service.go
│   ├── user_service.go
│── handler/
│   ├── sales_handler.go
│   ├── user_handler.go
│── main.go
```

### **Pros** ✅
- **Encapsulation**: Separates concerns clearly (e.g., data layer vs. business logic).  
- **Easier to follow SOLID principles**: Each package does one thing well.  
- **Reusable & Scalable**: You can reuse repositories/services in other contexts.  

### **Cons** ❌  
- **Harder for domain-driven development**: If your app grows, it might feel disconnected from business features.  
- **Cross-package dependencies**: Services might need multiple repositories, increasing dependency complexity.  

---

## **2️⃣ Grouping by Feature (Domain Separation)**
Instead of organizing by **layer**, you organize by **business features** (Sales, Users, Products, etc.).  

Example:
```
your_project/
│── sales/
│   ├── sales_repository.go
│   ├── sales_service.go
│   ├── sales_handler.go
│── users/
│   ├── user_repository.go
│   ├── user_service.go
│   ├── user_handler.go
│── products/
│   ├── product_repository.go
│   ├── product_service.go
│   ├── product_handler.go
│── main.go
```

### **Pros** ✅  
- **More modular**: Each feature (Sales, Users) is self-contained.  
- **Easier to scale**: If your team grows, developers can work on separate features independently.  
- **Better for microservices**: You can easily extract a feature into its own service later.  

### **Cons** ❌  
- **More code duplication**: Some repository/service logic may be duplicated.  
- **Feature teams might rewrite common logic**: Without clear shared utilities, different teams may implement the same logic differently.  

---

## **📌 When to Use Which?**
- **Small Projects** → Group by Layer (`repository`, `service`, `handler`).  
- **Large, Complex Projects** → Group by Feature (`sales/`, `users/`).  
- **Microservices** → Group by Feature (each feature might become its own microservice).  

If you're building a monolithic app but **want to scale it later**, you can use a **hybrid approach**:  
- Group by feature (`sales/`, `users/`) **inside** a monolith.  
- Keep common things (`database`, `config`) in a **shared** package.  

Would you like me to adjust the example for a feature-based structure? 🚀
