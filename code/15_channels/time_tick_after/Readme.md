This Go program demonstrates the use of **Go channels** with the `select` statement for concurrency and timers provided by the `time` package. Let’s break it down step by step:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Imports**:
   ```go
   import (
       "fmt"
       "time"
   )
   ```
   - The `fmt` package is used for printing messages.
   - The `time` package is used to create timers and manage durations.

2. **Main Function**:
   ```go
   func main() {
   ```
   - The program begins execution in the `main` function.

3. **Timer Channels**:
   ```go
   tick := time.Tick(1000 * time.Millisecond)
   ```
   - `time.Tick(duration)` returns a channel that sends a signal every `duration` (in this case, 1 second or 1000 ms). The `tick` channel continuously sends signals every second.

   ```go
   boom := time.After(5000 * time.Millisecond)
   ```
   - `time.After(duration)` returns a channel that sends a single signal after `duration` (in this case, 5 seconds or 5000 ms). The `boom` channel sends a signal once after 5 seconds.

4. **Infinite Loop with Select**:
   ```go
   for {
       select {
   ```
   - The loop runs indefinitely, continuously checking for events using the `select` statement. The `select` waits on multiple channel operations and executes the first one that becomes ready.

5. **Cases in the Select**:
   ```go
   case <-tick:
       fmt.Println("tick.")
   ```
   - This case executes whenever a signal is received from the `tick` channel (every second). It prints `tick.`.

   ```go
   case <-boom:
       fmt.Println("BOOM!")
       return
   ```
   - This case executes when the `boom` channel sends its signal (after 5 seconds). It prints `BOOM!` and exits the program using `return`.

   ```go
   default:
       fmt.Println("    .")
       time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
   ```
   - The `default` case runs if neither `tick` nor `boom` channels are ready. It prints `.` and pauses for 500 milliseconds using `time.Sleep`.

6. **Execution**:
   - Initially, neither `tick` nor `boom` channels are ready, so the `default` case runs, printing `.` every 500 milliseconds.
   - After 1 second, the `tick` channel sends a signal, and `tick.` is printed.
   - This continues every second, alternating between `tick.` and `.`, depending on the timing.
   - After 5 seconds, the `boom` channel sends its signal, printing `BOOM!` and exiting the program.

### Sample Output:
Here’s how the program would behave:

```plaintext
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
BOOM!
```

### Key Concepts:
1. **`time.Tick`**:
   - Creates a periodic ticker using a channel.

2. **`time.After`**:
   - Creates a one-shot timer using a channel.

3. **`select` Statement**:
   - Waits on multiple channel operations and picks the first one that's ready.

4. **`default` Clause**:
   - Executes immediately if no other cases are ready, providing a non-blocking fallback.

### Program Purpose:
This simple program demonstrates timer-based concurrency, which is useful for scheduling tasks or handling time-based events in Go applications.
